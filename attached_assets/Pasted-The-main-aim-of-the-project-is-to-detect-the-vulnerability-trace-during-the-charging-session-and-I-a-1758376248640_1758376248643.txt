Get-ExecutionPolicy -ListThe main aim of the project is to detect the vulnerability trace during the charging session and I am getting the issues during the port dumping process. I just connect all the wires and sensors to it. The voltage sensor, current sensor, relays, and ADFD display and RTC module to the ESP32 according to the connection I have given there in the file. So basically I am facing issues while just dumping the port, the port isn't proper and I am getting the issues in the port also. Most of the particular part of the port are proper and it is somewhat incorrect in the port of the IONO files which is why I am going to dumping the ESP32, the Arduino folder. And one more thing that the particular ESP32, ESP32-S3 should have to detect the vulnerability trace during the charging session. It is kind of the man-to-man attack detection of any thread is detected which suddenly stop that thread. It should have to be like antivirus at that time and block that thread and continue the charging. The admin can see its details using the API key which is currently in the setting page API. So the API section is for the particular machine is providing the interface where the data is coming from the ESP32 and send it to the dashboard. It is real-time data transfer throughout the sessions and the machine learning model which is we are trying to install in the ESP32 which is trying to import that in ESP32 which have to be analyze all the thread detection of vulnerability and send the real-time prediction to that particular machine API key to the dashboard. The main aim is already I have declared to you see all over the files and check whether what is the error in the codes and correct it. I need a proper codes and proper structure for that project and in the setting API keys there is one button like get get Arduino code. If we click on that particular get Arduino code it have to generate a zip file with pasted that particular API key where the button is clicked and the code should be we can dump in a particular ESP32 S3. So the stations have different different API keys the it should be how to create that particular way to that and the authentication like there should be authentication page for the login because I am getting issues like forgot password authentication because if we the user wanted to forget his password there is no way for that to send the OTP to the person to on his mail and check whether the things are going properly or not there should be authentication for forgot password add this thing into it also you    mak e prper prompt wer wall thisgs should hav eto mention properly
